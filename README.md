# Loan Default Prediction

A data science project to predict loan defaults using a Kaggle dataset (~148k loans, 34 features).

## Setup
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/vaibhav11123/Loan-Default-Modeling.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset) and place in `data/raw/`
4. Run Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
